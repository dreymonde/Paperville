 **Goal:** Design a city with at least **5 factories** and **30 houses** having more than **90% average comfort score** and **economic balance** value greater than **0.9**.

 And also to have fun ðŸ˜„
 
 Now, when you know all the tools to design your perfect city, as well as the rules that make it work, it's time to get your hands dirty.
 
 * callout(Urbanism):
 Applying some of the modern urbanism techniques â€” for example, making your neighborhoods _denser_ and decreasing the average block size (by making _more intersections_) will help you achieve better results.
